<p>
    Headcount is an application for the Rochester Institute of Technology's
    Software Engineering department. It was created by William Leuschner
    in the spring semester of 2017 to allow lab assistants to record how many
    people are using the team rooms and the Co-Lab, without having to write down
    a bunch of stuff on a clipboard.
</p>
<p>
    If you find any bugs, need assistance using the application, or have other
    comments, send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:wel2138@rit.edu">wel2138@rit
    </a> and mention "Headcount" in the subject.
